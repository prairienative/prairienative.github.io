We are of course big fans of [AWESOME](https://github.com/topics/awesome) lists or curated, annotated lists of content ... this particular one is about the background, history and theory of work in the realm of DIFFERENCE GRAPHs.

## The Theory Behind Difference Graphs

It is NOT [traditional Difference Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_theory) which has traditionally been thought as the differences between how men and women percieve an issue or topic ... because we do not particularly car about WHO is thinking about something; we completely remove the ad hominem or any reference to WHO thought something ... we are interested in what the differences might mean operationally, going forward -- we do not look in the rear view mirror ... WHO thought / wrote / said a collection of words is relevant ... our orientation in the grouping of or differences of ideas is about what it could mean to anyone in the future. Another point is that we do not wish to predestine the synthesis of a conversation, debate or argument into either compromise, conflict or cooperation ... the value placed on those outcomes is something that a community should choose, it is not part of what we care about in differences. 

***INFORMED*** difference theorgy can be thought of a subgroup of [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) [***Niave*** Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory) ... which similar to, but actually different than [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system) [Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) since [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system) is constrained to what machines would do with a certain block of text. We will tend to look at formalistic versions of [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) processing ... since ultimately, our application of difference theory is something that we expect to transfer to machines.
