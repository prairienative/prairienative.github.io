The progression of listification is like peeling an onion. Simple lists must be approachable and usable on the surface, all by themselves, as simple lists or learning syllabi ... but the process of drilling down or peering behind the curtain should also be open source and approachable, so that we teach how to teach others.

We can illustrate with something like learning a language. At first, we will want to understand the process of following [a tutorial to learn a language like Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and that process can progress toward fluency in Python [although any language will require continual use to develop mastery] ... then we will progress to that point where want to learn [how to build tutorials in something like Jupyter [using Binder]](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html) ... but then we progress to [learning how to set up BinderHub [which uses a JupyterHub running on Kubernetes for most of its functionality]](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/index.html#zero-to-binderhub).

Of course, that's not remotely close the end of it ... but the point is that to really understand a topic we must think about how we would teach others ... this means we must also be able to use AND EXTEND the tools of teaching others.

Fifty years ago in order to teach something like agricultural wiring or small gas engine repair, we would go to a VoAg shop ... but if we did not have a VoAg shop, we would have to learn how to build that VoAg shop FIRST before anyone could learn/teach anything in that shop. Nowadays, teaching others [around the world] increasingly means using an online interactive sessions in something like [ZOOM or Google Meet or, most likely BOTH, because different people will use different products and it will be necessary to adapt to each](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/google-meet-vs-zoom) ... of course, this means that we also have to be moderately fluent in both ZOOM and Google Meet ... as well as setting up things like [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) or [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started).

The progression of listification is like peeling an onion. Simple lists must be absolutely approachable as just curated, hyperlinked, annotated lists on the surface ... but the process of drilling down or peering behind the curtain should also be open source and approachable ... if we want to really learn anything, we must think in terms of teaching others how to teach others.
