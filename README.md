## ... it'll be a repositiory to accompany a novel ... The PrairieNative

It will be something like Walden, except not intentionally autobiographical [although all novels are perhaps autobiographical]  ... or maybe it's more akin to Dostoevky's story of a simpleton or common man who's just a bit different in [The Idiot](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2638/2638-h/2638-h.htm) ... but it is probably more about a quixotic attempt to be something like [John Galt](https://www.whoisjohngalt.com/) in Ayn's Rand's Atlas Shrugged.

It's not any big deal ... it's JUST a story of an average, ordinary, deeply flawed human, who thinks different and because of the excessively conservative conformity of inbred midwestern yocals who have never left their county must adapt to a bit of fire.

 It's just a story ... but right now, it's just sort of a placeholder for [PrairieNative.com](http://wwww.prairienative.com/)
