## ... it'll be a repositiory to accompany a novel ... PrairieNative

It will be something like Walden or Dostoevky's [The Idiot](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2638/2638-h/2638-h.htm) ... it's a history of lives adapted to a bit of fire.

 ... but right now, it's just sort of a placeholder for [PrairieNative.com](http://wwww.prairienative.com/)
