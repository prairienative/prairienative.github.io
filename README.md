## ... it'll be a repositiory to accompany a novel ... PrairieNative

It will be something like Walden or Dostoevky's [The Idiot](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2638/2638-h/2638-h.htm) ... or, might be more appropriately titled for Americans as ***The Simpleton** ... it's a history of activism and lives adapted to a bit of fire.

 ... but right now, it's just a placeholder for PrairieNative.com
