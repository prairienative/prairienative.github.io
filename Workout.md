## Why bother with physicultural intelligence?

*Maybe it is not blatantly obvious to everyone that cognitive intelligence begins with physical health. Workouts are part of maintaining optimal cognitive fitness. If people disagree this assertion ... well, the people who you interact with can probably tell, even if you can't or don't want to admit the cognitive importance of physical fitness.*

Generally, we kind of try to sort of stick with the ***Tabata*** workout format ... it's important to not be too dogmatic about this regimen ... but it helps to have a general structure or regimen or routine to stick to, without thinking too much about it.

We try to do one tabata as a break from work every half hour ... maybe work is break from the tabatas ... a tabata is an INTENSELY focused push ... a person can tolerate 4 minutes of anything ... thus that's the tabata workout format.

***Each 16 hr workday allows for 32 four-minute tabata workouts*** ... but there are interruptions like phone calls or other unplanned things throughout the day that mean just aiming for a number like 20 tabatas/day is going to be pretty aggressive.

A tabata itself involves 8 sets of reps ... each set lasts for 20s of particulary intense work to get in as many good reps as possible ... then, it's a matter resting or, more accurately, *thinking* about the next upcoming 20 seconds for 10s ... repeat this 7X to get the 8 sets.
